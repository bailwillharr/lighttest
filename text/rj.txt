Your lives shall pay the ransome of your fault:
For this time euery man depart in peace.

  <T PROSE><S %M: wife.> Who set this auncient quarrel first abroach?
Speake Nephew, were you by when it began?
  <S %Benuo:%> Here were the seruants of your aduersaries,
And yours close fighting ere I did approch.
  <S %Wife:%> Ah where is %Romeo%, saw you him to day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
  <S %Ben:%> Madame, an houre before the worshipt sunne
Peept through the golden window of the East.
A troubled thought drew me from companie:
Where vnderneath the groeu %sicamoure%,
That Westwars rooteth from the Citties side,
so early walking might I see your sonne.
I drew towards him, but he was ware of me,
And drew into the thicket of the wood:
I noting his affections by mine owne,
That most are busied when th'are most alone.
Pursued my honor, not pursuing his.
  <S %Moun:%> Black and portentious must this honor proue, 
Vnlesse good counnsaile doo the cause remooue.

Was that my Father that went hence so fast?
  <S %Ben:%> It was, what sorrow lengthens %Romeos% houres?

  <S %Ro:%> Out.
  <S %Ben:%> Of loue.
  <S %Ro:%> Out of her fauor where I am in loue.
  <S %Ben:%> Alas that loue so gentle in her view,
Should be so tyrranous and rough in proofe.
  <S %Ro:%> Alas that loue whose view in muffled still,
Should without lawes giue path-waies to our will:
Where shall we dine? Gods me, what fray was here?
Yet tell me not for I haue heard it all,
Heres much to doe with hate, but more with loue,                
Why then, O brawling loue, O louing hate,
O anie thing, of nothing first create!
O heauie lightnes serious vanitie!
Mishapen %Caos% of best seeming thinges,
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sicke health,
Still waking sleepe, that is not what it is:
This loue feele I, which feele no loue in this.
Doest thou not laugh?
  <S %Ben:%> No Cose I rather weepe.
  <S %Rom:%> Good hart at what?
  <S %Ben:%> At thy good hearts oppression.
  <S %Ro.%> Why such is loues transgression,
Griefes of mine owne lie heauie at my hart,
Which thou wouldst propogate to haue them prest
With more of thine, this griefe that thou hast showne,
Doth ad more griefe to too much of mine owne:
Loue is a smoke raisde with the fume of sighes
Being purgde, a fire sparkling in louers teares.
What is it else? A madnes most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preseruing sweet. Farewell Cose.
  <S %Ben:%> Nay Ile goe along.
And if you hinder me you doo me wrong.
  <S %Ro:%> Tut I haue lost my selfe I am not here,
This is not %Romeo%, hee's some other where.
  <S %Ben:%> Tell me in sadnes whome she is you loue.
  <S %Ro:%> What shall I grone and tell thee?
  <S %Ben:%> Why no, but sadly tell me who.
  <S %Ro.%> Bid a sickman in sadnes make his will.
Ah word ill vrgde to one that is so ill.
In sadnes Cosen I doo loue a woman.
  <S %Ben:%> I aimde so right, when as you said you lou'd.
  <S %Ro:%> A right good mark-man, and shee's faire I loue.
  <S %Ben:%> A right faire Cose is soonest hit.
  <S %Ro:%> But in that hit you misse, shee'le not be hit
With %cupids% arrow, she hath %Dianaes% wit,
And in strong proofe of chastitie well arm'd:
Gainst %cupids% childish bow she liues vnharm'd,
Shee'le not abide the siedge of louing tearmes,
Nor ope her lap to Saint seducing gold,
Ah she is rich in beautie, only poore,
That when she dies with beautie dies her store. <T SDE>%Exeu.%

And pittie tis, they liue at ods so long:
But leauing that, what say you to my sute?
  <S %Capu:%> What should I say more than I said before.
My daughter is a stranger in the world,
Shee hath not yet attainde to fourteene years:
Let two more sommers wither in their pride,
Before she can be thought fit for a Bride.
  <S %Paris:%> Younger than she are happie mothers made.
  <S %Cap:%> But too soone marde are these so early maried:
<T VERSE>But wooe her gentle %Paris%, get her heart,
My word to her consent is but a part.
This night I hold an old accustom'd Feast,
Whereto I haue inuited many a guest,
Such as I loue: yet you among the store,
One more most welcome makes the number more.
At my poore house you shall behold this night,
Earth tredding stars, that make darke heuen light:
Such comfort as doo lusty youngmen feele,
When well apparaisd April on the heele
Of lumping winter treads, euen such delights
Amongst fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house, heare all all see,
And like her most, whose merite most shalbe.
Such amongst view of many myne beeing one.

  <T VERSE><S %Ben:%> Tut man one fire burnes out anothers burning
One paine is lessned with anothers anguish:
Turne backward, and be holp with backward turning,
One desperate griefe cures with anothers languish.
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the ranke poyson of the old will die.
  <T PROSE><S %Romeo:%> Your Planton leafe is excellent for that.
  <S %Ben:%> For what?
  <S %Romeo:%> For your broken shin.
  <S %Ben:%> Why %Romeo% art thou mad?

Shut vp in prison, kept without my foode,
Whipt and tormented, and Godden good fellow.

With all the admired beauties of %Verona%,
Goe thither and with vnattained eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall shew,
And I will make thee thinke thy swan a crow.
  <S %Ro:%> When the  deuout religion of mine eye
Maintaines such falshood, then turne teares to fire,
And these who often drownde could neuer die,
Transparent Heretiques be burnt for liers

With nimble soles, I haue a soule of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot stirre.

A visor for a visor, what care I
What curious eye doth coate deformitie.
  <S %Rom:%> Giue me a Torch, elt wantons light of ahrt

For I am prouerbd with a Grandsire phrase,

The game was nere so faire and I am done.
  <S %Mer:> Tut dun's the mouse the Cunstables old word,
If thou beest Dun, weele draw thee from the mire
Of this surreuerence loue where in thou stickt.
Leaue this talke, we burne day light here.
  <S %Rom:%> Nay thats not so.  <S %Mer:%> I meane sir in delay,
We burne our lights by night, like Lampes by day,
Take our good meaning for our iudgement sits
Three times a day, ere once in her right wits.
  <S %Rom:%> So we meane well by going to this maske:
But tis no wit to goe.
  <S %Mer:%> Why %Romeo% may one aske?
  <S %Rom:%> I dreamt a dreame to night.
  <S %Mer:%> And so did I.  <S %Rom:%> Why what was yours?
  <S %Mer:%> That dreamers often lie.
  <S %Rom:%> In bed a sleepe while they dow dreame things true.
  <S %Mer:%> Ah then I see Queene Mab hath bin with you.
  <S %Ben:%> Queene Mab whats she?
She is the Fairies Midwife and doth come.
In shape no bigger than an Aggat stone
On the forefinger of a Burgomaster,
Drawne with a teeme of little Atomi,
A thwart mens noses when they lie a sleepe.
Her waggon spokes are made of spinners webs, 
The couer, of the winges of Grasshoppers,
The traces are the Moone shine watrie beames,
The collers crickets bones, the lash of filmes,
Her waggoner is a small gray coated flie,
Not halfe so big as is a little worme,
Pickt from the lasre finger of a maide,
And in this sort she gallops vp and downe
Through Louers braines, and then they dreame of loue.
O're Courtiers knees: who strait on cursies dreame
O're Ladies lips who dreame on kisses strait:
Which oft the anfrie Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breathes with sweet meats tainted are:
Sometimes she galllops ore a Lawers lap.
And then dreames he of smelling out a sute,
And sometime comes she with a tithe pigs taile,
Tickling a Parsons nose that lies a sleepe,
And then dreames he of another benefice:
Sometime she gallops ore souldiers nose,
And then dreames he of cutting forraine throats,
Of breaches ambuscados, countermines,
Of healthes giue fadome deepe, and then anon
Drums in his eare: at which he startes and wakes,
And sweares a Praier or two and sleepes againe.
This is that Mab that makes maids lie on their backes,
And proues them women of good cariage.
this is the verie Mab that plats the manes of Horses in the night,
And plats the Elfeldcks in foule sluttish haire,
Which once vntangled much misfortune breedes.
  <S %Rom:%> Peace, peace, thou talkst of nothing.
  <S %Mer:%> true I talke of dreames,
Which are the Children of an idle braine,
Begot of nothing but vaine fantasie,
Which is as thinne a substance as the aire,
And more inconstant than the winde,
Which wooes euen now the frose bowels of the north,
And being angred puffes away in haste,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
  <S %Ben:%> Come, come, this winde doth blow vs from out selues.
Supper is done and we shall come too late.
  <S %Ro:%> I feare too earlie, for my minde misgiues
Some consequence is hanging in that stars,
Which bitterly begins his fearefull date
With this nights reuels, and expiers the terme
Of a dispised life, closde in this breast,
By some vntimelie forser of vile death:
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Directs my saile, on lustie Gentlemen.
   <T SDD>%Enter old% Capulet %with the Ladies.%
  <T PROSE><S %Capu:%> Welcome Gentlemen, welcome Gentlemen,
Ladies that haue their toes vnplagud with Corns
Will haue about with you, ah ha my Mistresses,

Shee that makes daintie, shee Ile sweare hath Corns.
Am I come neere you now, welcome Gentlemen, welcome,
More lights you knaues, & turn these tables vp,
And quench the fire the roome is growne too hote.
Ah sirra, this vnlookt for sport comes well,

How long is it since you and I were in a Maske?
  <S %Cos:%> By Ladie sir tis thirtie yeares at least.
  <S %Cap:%> Tis not so much, tis not so much.
Tis since the mariage of %Lucentio%,
Come %Pentecost% as quicklie as it will,
Some fiue and twentie yeares, and then we maskt.
  <S %Cos:%> tis more, tis more, his sonne is elder far.
  <S %Cap:%> Will you tell me that it cannot be so,
His sonne was but a Ward three yeares agoe,
Good youths I faith Oh youth's a iolly thing.
  <S %Rom:%> What Ladie is that that doth in rich the hand
Of yonder Knight? O shee doth teach the torches to
            burne bright!
It seemes she hangs vpon the checke of night,
Like a rich iewell in an %Acthiops% eare,
Beautie too rich for vse, for earth too deare:
So shines a snow-white Swan trouping with Crowes,
As this faire Ladie ouer her fellowes showes.
The measure done, ile watch her place of stand,
And touching hers, make happie my rude hand
Did my heart loue till now? Forsweare it sight,
I neuer sae true beautie till this night.
  <S %Tib:%> This by his voice should be a %Mountague%,
Fetch me my rapier boy. What dares the slaue
Come hither couer'd with an Anticke face,
To scorne and ieere at our solemnitie?
Now by the stocke and honor of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it for no sin.
  <S %Ca:%> Why how now Cosen, wherefore storme you so.
  <S %Ti:%> Vncle this is a %Mountague% our foe,
A villaine that is hether come in spight,
To mocke at our solemnitie this night.
  <S %Ca:%> Young %Romeo%, is it not?     
  <S %Ti:%> It is that villaine %Romeo.%
  <S %Ca:%> Let him alone, he beares him like a portly gentleman,
And to speake truth, %Verona% brags of him,
As of a vertuous and well gouern's youth:
I would not for the wealth of all this towne,
Here in house doo him disparagement:
Therefore be quiet take no note of him,
Beare a faire presence, and put off these frownes,
An ill beseeming semblance for a feast.
  <S %Ti:%> It fits when such a villaine is a guest,
Ile not indure him.
  <S %Ca:%> He shalbe indured, goe to I say, he shall,
Am I the Master of the house or you?
You'le not indure him? God shall mend my soule
You'le make a mutenie amongst my guests,
You'le set cocke a hoope, you'le be the man.
  <S %Ti:%> Vncle tis a shame.
  <S %Ca:%> Goe too, you are a saucie knaue.
This tricke will scath you one day I know what.
Well said my hartes. Be quiet:
More light Ye knaue, or I will make you quiet.
  <S %Tibalt:%> Patience perrorce with wilfull choller meeting,
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greetings:
I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall
Now seeining sweet, conuert to bitter gall.
  <S %Rom:%> If I prophane with my vnworthie hand,
This holie shrine, the gentle finne is this:
My lips two blushing Pilgrims ready stand,
To smooth the rough touch with a gentle kisse.
  <S %Iuli:%> Good Pilgrime you doe wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly deuotion shewes in this:
For Saints haue hands which holy Palmers kisse.
  <S %Rom:%> Haue nor Saints lips, and holy Palmers too?
  <S %Iuli:%> Yes Pilgrime lips that they must vse in praier.
  <S %Ro:%> Why then faire saint, let lips do what hands doo,
They pray, yeeld thou, least faith turne to dispaire.
  <S %Iu:%> Saints doe not mooue though: grant nor praier
             forsake.
  <S %Ro:%> Then mooue not till my praiers effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours my sin is purgde.
  <S %Iu:%> Then haue my lips the sin that they haue tooke.
  <S %Ro:%> Sinne from my lips, O trespasse sweetly vrgde!
Giue me my sinne againe.
  <S %Iu:%> You kisse by the booke.
  <S Nurse:%> %Madame your mother calles.%
  <S %Rom:%> What is her mother?

We haue trifling foolish banquet towards.

Well then %I% thanke you honest Gentlemen,

  <S %Nur:%> %That as I thinke is yong% Petruchio.
  <S %Iul:%> Whats he that followes there that would not dance?
  <S Nur:%> %I know not.%
  <S %Iul:%> Goe learne his name, if he be married,
My graue is like to be my wedding bed.
  <S Nur:> %His name is% Romeo %and a% Mountague, %throuely%
         %sonne of your great enemie.%
  <S %Iul:%> My onely Loue sprung from my onely hate,
Too early seene vnknowne and knowne too late:
Prodigious birth of loue is this to me,
That I should loue a loathed enemie.
  <S Nurse:> %Whats this? whats that?%

  <T PROSE><S %Ben:%> %Romeo%, my cosen %Romeo.%
  <S %Mer:%> Doest nou heare he is wife,
Vpon my life he hath stolne him home to bed.
  <S %Ben:%> He came this way, and leapt this Orchard wall.
Call good %Mercutio.%
  <S %Mer:% Call, nay Ile coniure too.
<S %Romeo%>, madam, humors, passion, liuer, appeare thou in
likenes of a sigh: speek but one rime & I am satisfied, cry
buy ay me. Pronounce but Loue and Doue, speake to
my gossip %Venus% one faire word, one nickname for her
purblinde sonne and heire young %Abraham: Cupid% hee
that shot so trim when younf King %Cophetua% loued the
begger wench. Hee heares me not. I coniure thee by
%Rosalindes% bright eye, high forehead, and scarlet lip, her
prettie foote, straight leg, and quiuering thigh, and the
demaines that there adiacent lie, that in thy likenesse
thou appeare to vs.
  <S %Ben.%> If he doe heare thee thou wilt anger him.
  <S %Mer:%> But this cannot anger him; marrie if one shuld
raise a spirit in his Mistris circle of some strange fashion,
making it there to stand till she had laid it, and coniurde
it downe, that were some spite. My inuocation is faire
and honest, and in his Mistris name I coniure ouely but
to raise vp him.
  <S %Ben:%> Well he hath hid him selfe amongst those trees,
To be cosorted with the humerous night,
Blinded in this loue, and befits the darke
  <S %Mer:%> If loue be blind, loue will not hit the marke,
Now will he sit vnder a Medler tree,
And wish his Mistris were that kinde of fruite,
As maides call Medlers when they laugh alone.
Ah %Romeo%  that she were, ah that she were
An open %Et etera%, thou a poprin Peare.
%Romeo% God night, il'e to my trundle bed:
This field bed is too cold for mee.
Come lets away, for tis but vaine,
To seeke him here that meanes not to be found.
  <S %Ro:%> He iests at fears that neuer felt a wound:
But soft, what light orth yonder window breakes?
It is the East, and %Iuliet% is the Sunne,
Arise faire sunne, and kill the enuious Moone
That is alreadie sicke, and pale with griefe:
That thou her maid, art far more faire than she.
Be not her maide since she is enuious,
Her vestall liuerie is but pale and greene,
And none but fooles doe weare it, cast it off.
She speakes but she sayes nothing. What of that?
Her eye discouseth, I will answere it.
I am too bold, tis not to me she speakes,
Two of the fairest starres in al the skies,
Hauing some business, doe enter at her eyes
To twinckle in their spheares till they returne.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head,
The brightnes of her cheekes would shame those stars.
As day light doth a Lampe, her eyes in heauen,
Would through the airie region streame so bright,
That birdes would sing, and thinke it were not night.
Oh now she elanes her cheekes vpon her hand,
I would I were the gloue to that same hand,
That I might kisse that cheeke.
  <S %Iul:%> Ay me.
  <S %Rom:%> She speakes, Oh speake againe bright Angell:
For thou art as glorious to this night beeing ouer my head,
As is a winged messenger of heauen 
Vnto the white vpturned woondring eyes,
Of mortals that fall backe to gaze on him,
When he bestridews the lasie pacing cloudes,
and sailes vpon the bosome of the aire.
  <S %Iul:%> Ah %Romeo, Romeo%, wherefore art thou %Romeo?%
Denie thy Father, and refuse thy name,
Or if thou wilt not be but sworne my loue,
And Il'e no longer be a %Capulet.%
  <S %Rom:%> Shall I heare more, or shall I speake to this?
  <S %Iul:%> Tis but thy name that is mine enemie.
Whats %Mountague?% It is nor hand nor foote,
Nor arme, nor face, nor any other part.
Whats in a name? That which we call a Rose,
By any other name would smell as sweet:
So %Romeo% would, were he not %Romeo% cald,
Retaine the diuine perfection he owes:
Without that title %Romeo% part thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee,
Take all I haue.
  <S %Rom:%> I take thee at thy word,
Call me but loue, and il'e be new Baptisde,
Henceforth I neuer will be %Romeo.%
  <S %Iu:%> What man art thou, that thus beskrind in night,
Doest stumble on my counsaile?
  <S %Ro:%> By a name I know not how to tell thee.
My name  deare Saint is hatefull to my selfe,
Because it is an enemie to thee.
Had I it written I would teare the word.
  <S %Iul:%> My eares haue not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongues vtterance, yet I know the sound:
Art htou not %Romeo% and a %Mountagne?%
  <S %Ro:%> Neyther faire Saint, if eyther thee displease.
  <S %Iu:%> Hoe camst thou hether, tell me and wherfore?
The Orchard walles are high and hard to clime,
And the place death considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen finde thee here.
  <S %Ro:%> By lones light winges did I oreperch these wals,
For stonie limits cannot hold loue out,
And what loue can doo, that dares loue attempt,
Therefore thy kinsmena re no let to me.
  <S %Iul:%> If they doe finde thee they will murder thee.
  <S %Ro:%> Alas there lies more perrill in thine eyes,
Then twentie of their swords, looke thou but sweete, here.
And I am proofe against their enmitie.
  <S %Iul:%> I would not for the world they shuld find thee
  <S %Ro:%> I haue nights cloak to hide thee from their sight,
And but thou loue me let them finde me here:
For life were better ended by their hate,
than eath proroged wanting of thy loue.
  <S %Iu:%> By whose directions foundst thou out this place.
  <S %Ro:%> By loue, who first did prompt me to enquire,
I he gaue me cousaile and I lent him eyes.
I am no Pilot: yet wert thou as farre
As that vast shore, washt with the furthest sea,
I would aduenture for such marchandise.
  <S %Iul:%> Thou knowst the maske of night is on my face,
Els would a Maiden blush bepaint my cheeks:
For that which thou haste heard me speake to night,
Faine would I dwell on forme, faine faine denie,     
What I haue spoke: but farewell complements.
Doest thou loue me. Nay I know thou wilt say I,
And I will take thy word: but if thou swearst,
Thou maiest proue false:
At Louers periuries they say Ioue smiles.
Ah gentle %Romeo%, if thou loue pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou thinke I am too easely wonne,
Il'e frowne and say thee nay and be peruerse,
So thou wilt wooe: but els not for the world,
In truth faire %Mountague%, I am too fond,
And therefore thou maiest thinke my hauiour light:
But trust me gentleman Ile proue more true.
Than they that haue more cunning to be strange.
I should haue bin strange I must confesse,
But that thou ouer-heardst ere I was ware
My true loues Passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yeelding to light loue,
Which the darke night hath to discouered.
  <S %Ro:%> By yonder blessed Moone I sweare,
That tips with siluer all these fruit trees tops.
  <S %Iul:%> O sweare not by the Moone the vnconstant Moone,
That monthlie changeth in her circled orbe,
Least that thy loue proue proue likewise variable.
  <S %Ro:%> Now by
  <S %Iul:%> Nay doo not sweare at all,
Or of thou sweare, sweare at all,
Or if thou sweare, sweare by thy glorious selfe,
Which art the God of my Idolatrie,
And il'e beleeue thee.
  <S %Ro:%> If my true harts loue
  <S %Iul:%> Sweare not at al, though I doo ioy in thee,
I haue small ioy in this contract to night,
It is too rash, too sodaine, too vnaduisde,
Too like the lightning that doth cease to bee
Ere one can say it lightens. I heare some comming,
Deare loue adew, sweet %Mountague% be true,
Stay but a little and il'e come againe.
  <S %Ro:%> O blessed blessed night, I feare being night,
All this is but a dreame I heare and seem
Too flattering true to be substantiall.
  <S %Iul:%> Three wordes good %Romeo% and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of loue be honourable?
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to morrow
By one that il'e procure to come to thee:
Where and what time thou wilt performe that right,
And al my fortunes at thy foote il'e lay,
And follow thee my Lord through out the world.
  <S %Ro:%> Loue goes toward loue like schoole boyes from
             their bookes,
But loue from loue, to schoole with heauie lookes.
  <S %Iul:%> %Romeo, Romeo%, O for a falkners voice,
To lure this Tassell gentle backe againe:
Bondage is hoarse and may not crie aloud,
Els would I teare the Caue where Eccho lies
And make her airie voice as hoarse as mine,
With repetition of my %Romeos% name.
%Romeo?%
  <S %Ro:%> It is my soule that calles vpon my name,
How siluer sweet sound louers tongues in night.
  <S %Iul:%> Romeo?
  <S %Ro:%> Madame.
  <S %Iul:%> At what a clocke to morrow shall I send?
  <S %Ro:%> At the houre of nine.
  <S %Iul:%> I will not faile, tis twentie yeares till then.
<S %Romeo%> I haue forgot why, I did call thee backe.
  <S %Rom:%> Let stay here till you remember it.
  <S %Iul:%> I shall forget to haue thee still staie here,
Remembring how I loue thy companie.
  <S %Rom:%> And il'e stay still to haue thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
  <S %Iu:%> Tis almost morning I would haue thee gone.
But yet no further then a wantons bird,
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a pore prisoner in his twisled giues,
And with a silke thred puls it backe againe,
Too louing iealous of his libertie.
  <S %Ro:%> Would I were thy bird.
  <S %Iul:%> Sweet so would I,
Yet I should kill thee with much cherrishing thee.
Good night, good night, parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till be morrow.
  <S %Rom:%> Sleepe dwell vpon thine eyes, peace on thy breast,  
I would that I were sleep and peace of sweet to rest.
Now will I to my Ghostly fathers Cell,
His help to craue, and my good hap to tell.
            <T SDD>%Enter Frier Francis.%
  <S %Frier:%> The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night,
Checkring the Easterne clouds with streakes of light,
And flecked darkenes like a drunkard reeles,
From forth daies path, and %Titans% fierie wheeles:
Now ere the Sunne aduance his burning eye.
The world to cheare, and nights darke dew to drie
We must vp fill this oasier Cage of ours,
With balefull weeds, and precious iuyeed flowers.
Oh mickle is the powerfull grace that lies
In hearbes, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile, that vile on earth doth liue,
But to the earth some speciall good doth giue:
Nor nought so good, but straind from that faire vse,
Reuolts to vice and stumbles on abuse:
Vertue it selfe turnes vice being misapplied,
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rinde of this small flower,
Poyson hath residence, and medeecine power:
For this being smelt too, with that part cheares ech hart,
Being tasted slaies all sences with the hart.
Two such opposed foes incampe them still,
In man as well as herbes, grace and rude will,
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soone the canker death eats vp that plant.
  <S %Rom:%> Good morrow to my Ghostly Confessor.
  <S %Fri:%> %Benedicte%, what earlie tongue so soone saluteth me?
Yong sonne it argues a distempered head,
So soone to bid good morrow to my bed.
Care keepes his wateh in euerie old mans eye,
And where care lodgeth, sleep can neuer lie:
But where vnbrused youth with vnflust braines
Doth couch his limmes, there golden sleepe remaines:
Therefore thy earlines doth me assure,
Thou art vprows'd by some distemperature.
Or if not so, then here I hit it righ
Our %Romea% hath not bin a bed to night.
  <S %Ro:%> The last was true, the sweeter rest was mine.
  <S %Fr:%> God pardon sin, were thou with %Rosaline?%
  <S %Ro:%> With %Rosaline% my Ghostly father no,
I haue forgot that name, and that names woe.
  <S %Fri:%> Thats my good sonne: but where hast thou bin then?
  <S %Ro:%> I tell thee ere thou aske it me againe,
I haue bin feasting with mine enemie:
Where on the sodaine one hath wounded mee
Thats by me wounded, both our remedies
With in thy help and holy phisicke lies.
I beare no hatred blessed man: for loe
My intercession likewise steades my foe.
  <S %Frier:%> Be plaine my sonne and homely in thy drift,
Ridling confession findes but riding shrift.
  <S %Rom:%> Then plainely know my harts deare loue is set
On the faire daughter of rich %Capulet:%
As mince on hers, so hers likewise on mine,
And all combind, saue what thou must combine
By holy marriage: where, and when, and how,
We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vowes,
Il'e tell thee as I passe: But this I pray,
That thou consent to marrie vs to day.
  <S %Fri:%> Holy %S. Francis%, what a chanfe is here?
Is %Rosaline% whome thou diest loue so deare
So soone forsooke, lo yong mens loue, then lies
Not truelie in their harts, but in their eyes.
%Iesu Maria%, what a deale of brine
Hath washt thy sallow cheekes for %Rosaline?%
How much salt water cast away in waste,
To season loue, that of loue doth not taste.
The sunne not yet thy sighes from heauen cleares,
Thy old grones ring yet in my ancient eares,
And loe vpon thy cheeke the staine doth sit,
Of an old teare that is not washt off yet.
If euer thou wert thus, and these woes thine,
Thou  and these woes were all for %Rosaline%,
And art thou changde, pronounce this sentence then
Women may fal, when ther's no strength in men.
  <S %Rom:%> Thou chidst me oft for louing %Rosaline.%   
  <S %Fr:%> For doating, not for louing, pupill mine.
  <S %Rom:%> And badst me burie loue.
  <S %Fr:%> Not in a graue,
To lay one in another out to haue.
  <S %Rom:%> I pree thee chide not, she whom I loue now
Doth grace for grace, and loue for loue allow:
The other did not so.
  <S %Fr:%> Oh she knew well
Thy loue did read by rote, and could nos spell.
But come yong Wauerer, come goe with mee,
In one respect Ile thy assistant bee:
For this alliaunce may so happie proue,
To turne your Housholds rancour to pure loue.  <T SDE>%Exeunt.%

        <T SDD>%Enter Mercutio, Benuolio.%
               
  <T PROSE><%Mer:%> Why whats become of %Romeo?% came he not
                      home to night?
  <S %Ben:%> Not to his Fathers, I spake with his man.
  <S %Mer:%> Ah that sam pale hard hearted wench, that %Rosaline%
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
  <S %Mer:%> %Tybalt% the Kinsman of olde %Capolet%
Hath sent a Letter to his Fathers House:
Some challenge on my life.
  <S %Ben:%> %Romeo% will answere it.
  <S %Mer:%> I, anie man that can write may answere a letter.
  <S %Ben:%> Nay, he will answere the letters master if hee be
               challenged.
  <S %Mer:%> Who, %Romeo?% why he is alreadie dead: stabd
with a white wenches blacke eye, shot thorough the eare
with a loue song, the verie pinne of his heart cleft with the
blinde bow-boyes but-shaft. And is he a man to encounter
%Tybalt?%
  <S %Ben:%> Why what is %Tybalt?%
  <S %Mer:%> More than the prince of cattes I can tell you, Oh
he is the couragious captaine of complements. Catso; he 
fightes as you sing pricke-song, keepes time dystance and
proportion, rests me his minum rest one two and the thirde
in your bosome, the very butcher of a silken button, a Duel-
list a Duelist, a gentleman of the very first house of the first
and second cause, ah the immortal Passado, the Punto re-
uerso, the Hay.
  <S %Ben:%> The what?
  <S %Me:%> The Poxe of such limping antique affecting fan-
tasticoes these new tuners of accents. By Iesu a very good
blde, a very tall man, a very good whoore. Why graund-
sir is not this a miserable case that we should be stil afflicted
with these strange flies: these fashionmongers, these par-
donmees, that stand so much on the new forme, that they
cannot fit at ease on the old bench. O their bones, theyr
bones.
  <S %Ben.%> Heere comes %Romeo.%
  <S %Mer:%> Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering. O flesh flesh
how art thou fishified. Sirra now is he for the numbers that
Petrarch flowdin: %Laura% to his Lady was but a kitchin
drudg, yet she had a better loue to berime her: Dido a dow-
dy Cleopatra a Gypsie, %Hero% and %Hellen% hildings and harle-
tries: %Thisvie% agray eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
%Romeo% bon iour there is a French curtesie to your French
flop: yee gaue vs the counterfeit fairely yesternight.
  <S %Rom:%> What counterfeit fairely yesternight.
  <S %Me:%> The slip the slip, can you not conceiue?
  <S %Rom:%> I cry you mercy my busines was great, and in such
a case as mine, a man may straine curtesie.
  <S %Mer:%> Oh thats as much to say as such a case as yours wil
constraine a man to bow in the hams.
  <S %Rom:%> A most curteous exposition.
  <S %Me:%> Why I am the very pinke of curtesie.
  <S %Rom:%> Pinke for flower?
  <S %Mer:%> Right.
  <S %Rom:%> Then is my Pumpe well flour'd:
  <S %Mer:%> Well said, follow me nowe that iest till thou hast
worne out thy Pumpe, that when the single sole of its worn
the iest may remaine after the wearing solie singular.
  <S %Rom:%> O single soald iest solie singular for the singlenes.
  <S %Me.%> Come between vs good %Benuolio%, for my wits faile.
  <S %Rom:%> Swits and spurres, swits & spurres, or Ile cry a match.
  <S %Mer:%> Nay if thy wits runne the wildgoose chase, I haue
done: for I am sure thou hast more of the goose in one of
thy wits than I haue in al my fiur: Was I with you there for
the goose?
  <S %Rom:%> Thou wert neuer with me for any thing, when
thou wert not with me for the goose.
  <S %Me:%> Ile bite thee by the eare for that iest.
  <S %Rom:%> Nay good goose bite not.
  <S %Mer:%> Why thy wit is a bitter sweeting, a most sharp sauce
  <S %Rom:%> And was it not well seru'd in to a sweet goose?
  <S %Mer:%> Oh heere is a witte of Cheuerell that stretcheth
from an ynch narrow to an ell broad.
  <S %Rom:%> i strecht it our for the word broad, which added to
the goose, proues thee faire and wide a broad goose.
  <S %Mer:%> Why is not this better now than groning for loue?
why now art thou sociable, now art thou thy selfe, nowe art
thou what thou art, as wel by arte as nature. This driueling
loue is like a great naturall, that runs vp and downe to hide
his bable in a hole.
  <S %Ben:%> Stop there.
  <S %Me:%> Why thou wouldst haue me stopp my tale against
the haire.
  <S %Ben:%> Thou wouldst haue me stopp my tale against

  <S %Ben:%> Thou wouldst haue made thy tale too long?
  <S %Mer:%> Tut man thou art deceiued, I meant to make it
short, for I was come to the whole depth of my tale? and
meant indeed to occupie the argument no longer.
  <S %Rom:%> Heers goodly geare.

  <T PROSE><S %Fr:%> Solorne in %Mantua%, Ile finde out your man,
And he shall signifie from time to time:
Euery good hap that doth befall thee heere.
Farewell.
  <S %Rom:%> But that a ioy, past ioy cryes out on me,
It were a grife so breefe to part with thee.

         <T SDD>%Enter olde Capulet and his wife, with
                             County Paris.%

  <T PROSE><S %Cap:%> Thinges haue fallen out Sir so vnlucky,
That we haue had no time to moue my daughter.
Looke yee Sir, she lou'd her kinsman dearely,
And so did I. Well, we were borne to dye,
Wife wher's your daughter, is she in her chamber?
I thinke she meanes not to come downe to night.
  <S %Par:%> These times of woe affoord no time to wooe,
Maddam farwell, commend me to your daughter.

       <T SDD>%Paris offers to goe in, and Capolet%
                       %calles him againe.%

  <T PROSE><S %Capt:%> Sir %Paris?% Ile make a desperate tender of my child.
I thinke she will be rulde in all respectes by mee:
But soft what day is this?
  <S %Par:%> Munday my Lord.
  <S %Cap:%> Oh then Wensday is too soone,
On Thursday let it be: you shall be maried.
Wee'le make no great a doe a frend or two, or so:
For looke ye Sir, %Tybalt% being slaine so lately,
It will be thought we held him care leslye:
If we should reuell much, therefore we will haue
Some halfe a dozen frends, and make no moe adoe.
But what say you to Thursday.
  <S %Par:%> My Lorde I wishe that Thursday were to mor-
        row.
  <S %Cap:%> Wife goe you to your daughter, ere you goe to
        bed.
Acquaint her with the County %Paris% loue,
Fare well my Lord till Thursday next.
Wife gette you to your daughter. Light to my Chamber.
Afore me it is so very very late,
That we may call it earely by and by.
 
             <T SDD>%Enter Romeo and Iuliet at the window.%

  <T PROSE><S %Iul:%> Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet nere day,
It was the Nightingale and not the Larke
That pierst the fearfull hollow of thine eare:
Nighly she sings on yon Pomegranate tree,
Beleeue me loue, it was the Nightingale.
  <S %Rom:%> It was the Larke, the Herald of the Morne,
And not the Nightingale. See Loue what enuious strakes
Doo lace the seuering clowdes in yonder East.
Nights candles are burnt out, and iocond Day
Stands tiptoed on the mystie mountaine tops.
I must be gone and liue, or stay and dye.
  <S %Jul:%> Yon light is not day light, I know it I:
It is some Meteor that the Sunne exhales,
To be this night to thee a Torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to %Mantua.%
Then stay awhile, thou shalt not goe soone.
  <S %Rom:%> Let me stay here, let me be tane, and dye:
If thou wilt haue it so, I am content.
Ile say yon gray is not the Mornings Eye,
It is the pale reflex of %Cynthias% brow.
Ile say it is the Nightingale that beares
The vaultie heauen so high aboue out heads,
And not the Larke the Messengeer of Morne.
Come deat and welcome, %Iuliet% wils it so.
What sayes my Loue? Lets talke, tis not yet day.
  <S %Jul:%> It is, it is, be gone, flye hence away.
It is the Larke that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh Discords and vnpleasing Sharpes.
Some say, the Larke makes sweete Diuision:
This doth not so: for this diuideth vs.
Some say the Larke and loathed Toad change eyes,
I would that now they had changd voyces too:
Since arme from arme her voyce doth vs affray,
Hunting thee hence with Hunts vp to the day.
So now be gone, more light and light it growes.
  <S %Rom:%> More light and light, more darke and darke our
              woes.
Farewell my Loue, one kisse and Ile descend.

            <T SDD>%He goeth downe.%
 
  <T PROSE><S %Jul:%> Art thou gone so my Lord, my Loue, my Frend?
I must heare from thee euerie day in the hower:
For in an hower there are manie minutes,
Minutes are dayes, so will I number them:
Oh, by this count I shall be much in yeares,
Ere I see thee againe.
  <S %Rom:%> Farewell, I will omit no opportunitie
That may conueigh my greetings loue to thee.
  <S %Iul:%> On, thinkst thou we shall euer meete againe
  <S %Rom:%> No doubt, no doubt, and all this woe shall serue
For sweete discourses in the time to come.
  <S %Jul:%> Oh God, I haue an ill diuining soule.
Me thinkes I see thee now thou art below
Like one dead in the bottome of a Tombe:
Either mine ey-sight failes, or thou lookst pale.
  <S %Rom:%> And trust me Loue, in my eye so doo you,
Drie sorrow drinkes our blood: adieu, adieu.     <T SDE>%Exit.%

             <T SDD>%Enter Nurse baslely.%

  <T PROSE><S %Nur:%> Madame beware, take heed the day is broke,
Your Mother's comming to your Chamber, make all sure.
             <T SDD>%She goeth downe from the window.%

             <T SDD>%Enter Iuliets Mother, Nurse.%

  <T PROSE><S %Moth:%> Where are you Daughter?
  <S %Nur:%> What Ladie, Lambe, what %Iuliet?%

  <S %Nur:%> It is your Mother.
  <S %Moth:%> Why how now %Juliet?%
  <S %Iul:%> Madam, I am not well.
  <S %Moth:%> What euermore weeping for your Cosens death:
I thinke thoult wash him from his graue with teares.
  <S Iul:%> I cannot chuse, hauing so great a losse.
  <S %Moth:%> I cannot blame thee.
But it greeues thee more that Villaine liues.
  <S %Iul:%> What Villaine Madame?
  <S %Moth:%> That Villaine %Romeo.%
  <S %Iul:%> Villaine and he are manie miles a sunder.
  <S %Moth:%> Content thee Girle, if I could finde a man
I soone would send to %Mantua% where he is,
That should soone bestow on him so sure a draught,
As he should soone beare %Tybalt% companie.
  <S %Iul:%> Finde you the meanes, and Ile finde such a man;
For whilest he liues, my heart shall nere be light
Till I behold him, dead is my poore heart.
Thus for a Kinsman vext?
  <S %Moth:%> Well let that passe. I come to bring thee ioyfull newes?
  <S %Iul:%> And ioy comes well in such a needfull time.
  <S %moth:%> Well then, thou hast a carefull Father Girle,    
And one who pittying thy needfull state,
Hath found thee out a happie day of ioy.
  <S %Iul:%> What day is that I pray you?
  <S %Moth:%> Marry my Childe,
The gallant, yong and youthfull Gentleman,
The Countie %Paris% at Saint %Peters% Church,
Early next Thursday morning must prouide,
To make you there a glad and ioyfull Bride.
  <S %Iul:%> Now by Saint %Peters% Church and %Peter% too,
He shall not there make mee a ioyfull Bride.
Are these the newes you had to tell me of?
Marrie here are newes indeed. Madame I will not marrie
        yet.
And when I doo, it shal be rather %Romeo% whom I hate,
Than Countie %Paris% that I cannot loue.

              <T SDD>%Enter olde Capolet.%

  <T PROSE><S%Moth:%> Here comes your Father, you may tell him so,
  <S %Capo:%> Why how now, euermore showring?
In one little bodie thou resemblest a sea, a barke, a storme:
For this thy bodie which I tearme a barke,
Still floating in thy euerfalling teares,
And tost with sighes arising from thy hart:
Will without succour ship wracke presently.
But heare you Wife, what haue you sounded her, what saies
     she to it?
  <S %Moth:%> I haue, but she will none she thankes ye:
Would God that she wer married to her graue.
  <S %Capo:%> What will she not, doth she not thanke vs, doth
she not wexe proud?
  <S %Iul:%> Not proud ye haue, but thankfull that ye haue:
Proud can I neuer be of that I hate,
But settle your fine ioynts on Thursday next
To goe with %Paris% Saint %Peters% Church,
Or I will drag you on a hurdle thether.
Out you greene sicknes baggage, out you tallow face.
  <S %Iu:%> Good father heare me speake?

                 <T SDD>%She kneeles downe.%
  <T PROSE><S %Cap:%> I tell thee what, eyther resolue on thursday next
To goe with %Paris% to Saint Peters Church:
Or henceforth neuer looke me in the face.
Speake not, reply not, for my fingers ytch.
Why wife, we thought that we were scarcely blest
That God had sent vs but this onely chyld:
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we haue a crosse in hauing her.
  <S %Nur:%> Mary God in heauen blesse her my Lord.
You are too blame to rate her so.
  <S %Cap:%> And why my Lady wisedome? hold your tung,
Good prudence smatter with your gossips, goe.
  <S %Nur:%> Why my Lord I speake no treason.
  <S %Cap:%> Oh goddegodden.
Vtter your grauity ouer a gossips boule,
For heere we need it not.
  <S %Mo:%> My Lord ye are too hotte.
  <S %Cap:%> Gods blessed mother wife it mads me,
Day, night, early, late, at home, abroad,
Alone, in company, waking or sleeping.
Still my care hath beene to see her matcht.
And hauing now found out a Gentleman,
Of Princely parentage, youthfull, and nobly trainde.
Stuft as they say with honorable parts.
Proportioned as ones heart coulde wish a man:
And then to haue a wretched whyning foole,
A puling mammet in her fortunes tender,
Today I cannot loue, I am too young, I pray you pardon
     mee?
But if you cannot wedde Ile pardon you,
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Looke to it, thinke ont, I doe not vse to iest.
I tell yee what, Thursday is neere,
Lay hand on heart, aduise, bethinke your selfe,
If you be mine, Ile giue you to my frend:
If not, hand, drowne, starue, beg,
Dye in the streetes: for by my soule
Ile neuer more acknowledge thee,
Nor what I haue shall euer doe thee good,
Thinke ont, looke toot, I doe not vie to iest.      <T SDE>%Exit.%
  <T PROSE><S %Iul:%> Is here no pitty hanging in the cloudes,
That lookes into the bottom of my woes?
I doe beseech you Madame, cast me not away,
Defer this mariage for a day or two,
Or if you cannot, make my mariage bed
In that dimme monument where %Tybalt% lyes.
  <S %Moth:%> Nay be assured I will not speake a word.
Do what thou thou wilt for I haue done with thee.      <T SDE>%Exit.%
  <T PROSE><S %Iul:%> Ah Nurse what comfort? what counsell canst thou
              giue me.
  <S %Nur:%> Now trust me Madame, I know not what to say:
Your %Romeo% he s banisht, and all the world to nothing
He neuer dares returne to challendge you.
Now I thinke good you marry with this County,
Oh he is a gallant Gentleman, %Romeo is but a dishclout
In respect of him. I promise you
I thinke you happy in this second match.
As for your husband he is dead:
Or twere as good he were, for you haue no vse of him.
  <S %Iul:%> Speakst thou this from thy heart?
  <S %Nur:%> I and from thy soule, or els beshrew them both.
  <S %Iul:%> Amen.
  <S %Nur:%> What say you Madame?
  <S %Iul:%> Well, thou hast comforted me wondrous much.
I pray thee goe thy waies vnto my mother
Tell her I am gone hauing displeasde my Father.
To Fryer %Laurence% Cell to confesse me,
And to be absolu'd.                
  <S %Nur:%> I will, and this is wisely done.
                                      <T SDD>%She lookes after Nurse.%

  <T PROSE><S %Iul:%> Auncient damnation, O most cursed fiend.
Is it more sinne to wish me thus forsworne,
Or to dispraise him with the selfe same tongue
That thou hast praisde him with aboue compare
So many thousand times? Goe Counsellor,
Thou and my bosom henceforth shal be twaine.
Ile to the Fryer to know his remedy,
If all faile els, I haue the power to dye.
                                               <T SDE>%Exit.%

              <T SDD>%Enter Fryer and Paris.%

  <T PROSE><S %Fr:%> On Thursday say ye: the time is very short,
  <S %Par:%> My Father %Capolet% will haue it so,
And I am nothing slacke to slow his hast.
  <S %Fr:%> You say you doe not know the Ladies minde?
Vneuen is the course, I like it not.
  <S %Par:%> Immoderately she weepes for %Tybalts% death,
And therefore haue I little talkt of loue.
For %Venus% smiles not in a house of teares.

Across the world a sheet of grey
comes to end another day  
the curtains drape across the sky
As the nighttime passes by 
And through the darkness beauty rears
the couragious moon appears
sitting boldly way up high(in the clouds) 
watching over you and I
watching over strong and proud
the stars like precious jewels they shine
diamonds on black velvet peeping through 
peeping through their heavenly shrine
diamonds on velvet opal stone

Now sir, her father thinkes it daungerous:
 That she doth giue her sorrow so much sway.
And in his wisedome hasts our mariage,
to stop the inundation of her teares.
Which too much minded by her selfe alone
May be put from her by societie.
Now doe ye know the reason of this hast,
  <S %Fr:%> I would I knew not why it should be slowd.

                     <T SDD>Enter %Paris%.

<T PROSE>Heere comes the Lady to my cell,
  <S %Par:%> Welcome my love, my Lady and my wife:

  <S %Par:%> That may be, must be live, on thursday next.
  <S %Iu:%> What must be shalbe.
  <S %Fr:%> Thats a certaine text.
  <S %Par:%> What come ye to confession to this Fryer.
  <S %Iu:%> To tell you that were to confesse to you.
  <S %Par:%> Do not deny to him that you love me.
  <S %Iul:%> I will confesse to you that I love him,
  <S %Par:%> So I am sure you will that you love me.
  <S %Iu:%> And if I doe, it wilbe of more price,
Being spoke behinde your backe, than to your face.
  <S %Par:%> Poore soule thy face is much abus'd with teares.
  <S %Iu:%> The teares have got small victory by that,
For it was bad enough before their spite.
  <S %Par:%> Thou wrongst it more than teares by that report.
  <S %Iu:%> That is no wrong sir, that is a truth:
And what I spake I spake it to my face.
  <S %Par%:> Thy face is mine and thou hast flaundred it,
  <S %Iu:%> It may be so, for it is not mine owne.
Are you at leasure holy Father now:
Or shall I come to you at evening Masse?
  <S %Fr:%> My leasure serves me pensive daughter now.
 My Lord we must entreate the time alone.
  <S %Par:%> Good sheild I should disturbe deuotion,
%Iuliet% farwell, and keep this holy kisse.
                                             <T SDE>%Exit Paris.%

  <T PROSE><S %Iu:%> Goe shut the doore and when thou hast done so,
Come weepe with me that am past cure, past help,
  <S %Fr:%> Ah %Iuliet% I already know thy griefe,
I heare thou must and nothing may proroge it,
On Thursday next be married to the Countie.
  <S %Iul:%> Tell me not Frier that thou hearst of it,
Vnlesse thou tell me how we may preuent it.
Giue me some sudden counsell: els behold
Twixt my extreames and me, this bloodie Knife
Shall play the Vmpeere, arbitrating that
Which the Commission of thy yeares and arte
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Speake not, be briefe: for I desire to die,
If what thou speakst, speake not of remedie.
  <S %Fr:%> Stay %Juliet%, I doo spie a kinde of hope,
Which craues as desperate an execution,
As that is desperate we would preuent.
If rather than to marrie Countie %Paris%
Thou hast the strength or will to slay thy selfe,
Tis not vnlike that thou wilt vndertake
A thing like death to hyde away this shame,
That coapst with death to chyde away this shame,
And if thou doost, Ile giue thee remedie
  <S %Jul:%> Oh bid me leape (rather than marrie %Paris%)
From off the battlements of yonder tower:
Or chaines me to some steepie mountaines top,
Where roaring Beares and sauage Lions are:
Or shut me nightly in a Charnell-house,
With reekie shankes, and yeolow chaples sculls:
Or lay me in tombe with one new dead:
Things that to heare them namde haue made me tremble;
And I will doo it without feare or doubt,
To keep my selfe a faithfull vnstaind Wife
To my deere Lord, my deerest %Romeo.%
  <S %Fr:%> Hold %Iuliet%, hie thee home, 
And I will doo it without feare or doubt,
To keep my selfe a faithfull vnstaind Wife
To my deere Lord, my deerest %Romeo.%
  <S %Fr:%> Hold %Iuliet%, hie thee home, get thee to bed,
Let not thy Nurse lyue with thee in thy Chamber:
And when thou art alone, take thou this Violl,
And this distilled Liquor drinke thou off:
When presently through all thy veynes shall run
A dull and heauie slumber, which shall seaze
Each vitall spirit: for no Pulse shall keepe
His naturall progresse, but surcease to beate:
No signe of breath shall testifie thou liust.
And in this borrowed likenes of shrunke death,
Thou shalt remaine full two and fortie houres.
And when thou art laid in thy Kindreds Vault,
Ile send in hast to %Mantua% to thy Lord,
And he shall come and take thee from thy graue.
  <S %Iul:%> Frier I go, be sure thou send for my deare %Romeo.%

Of froward wilfull opposition
Gainst you and your behests, and am enioynd

And craue remission of so soule a fact.

To see her thus conformed to our will.            <T SDE>%Exeunt.%

Ah, I doo take a fearfull thing in hand.
What if this Potion should not worke at all,
Must I of force be married to the Countie?
This shall forbid it. Knife, lye thou there.
What if the Frier should giue me this drinke
To poyson mee, for feare I should disclose
Our former marriage? Ah, I wrong him much,
He is a holy and religious Man:
I will not entertaine so bad a thought.
What if I should be stifled in the Toomb?
Awake an houre before the appointed time:
Ah then I feare I shall be lunaticke,
And playing with my dead forefathers bones,
Dash out my franticke braines. Me thinkes I see
My Cosin %Tybalt% weltring in his bloud,

(Strange dreames that giue a dead man leaue to thinke)
And that my Ladie %Iuliet% came to me,
And breathd such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reuiude and was an Emperour.

Here dwells a Pothecarie whom oft I noted
As I past by, whose needie shop is stufft
With beggerly accounts of emptie boxes:
And in the same an %Aligarta% hangs,
Olde ended of packthred, and cakes of Roses.
Are thinly strewed to make vp a show.
Him as I noted, thus with my selfe I thought:
And if a man should need a poyson now,
(Whose present sale is death in %Mantua%)
Here he might buy it. This thought of mine
Did but forerunne my need: and here about he dwels.
Being Holiday the Beggars shop is shut.

But yet the law is death to those that sell them
  <S %Rom:%> Art thou so bare and full of pouertie,
And doost thou feare to violate the Law?

And therefore make no conscience of the law:

And starued Famine dwelleth in thy cheekes.
  <S %Apo:%> My pouertie but not my will consents.
  <S %Rom:%> I pay thy pouertie, but not thy will.

               ron.
And take these letters, early in the morning,
See thou deliuer them to my Lord and Father.
So get thee gone and trouble me no more.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my Ladies face,
But chiefly to take from her dead finger,
A precious ring which I must vse
In deare imployment but if thou wilt stay,
Further to prie in what I vndertake,
By heauen Ile teare thee ioynt by ioynt,
And strewe thys hungry churchyard with thy lims.
The time and my intents are sauage, wilde.

Can vengeance be pursued further then death?

Good youth be gone, tempt not a desperate man.
Heape not another sinne vpon my head
By sheding of thy bloud, I doe protest

What said my man, when my betossed soule
Did not regard him as we past a long.
Did he not say %Paris% should haue maried

But I will satifie thy last request,
For thou hast prizd thy loue aboue thy life.
Death lye thou there, by a dead man interd,
How oft haue many at the houre of death
Beene blith and pleasant? which their keepers call
A lightning before death  But how may I
Call this a lightning. Ah deare %Iuliet%,
How well thy beauty doth become this graue?
O I beleeue that vnsubstanciall death,
Is amorous, and doth court my loue.
Therefore will I, O heere, O euer heere,
Set vp my euerlasting rest
With wormes, that are thy chamber mayds.

Bring forth the parties in suspition.
  <S %Fr:%> I am the greatest able to doo least.
Most worthie Prince, heare me but speake the truth.  
And Ile informe you how these things fell out.
%Juliet% here slaine was married to that %Romeo%,
Without her Fathers or her Mothers grant:
The Nurse was priuie to the marriage.
The balefull day of this vnhappie marriage,
Was %Tybalts% doomesday: for which %Romeo%
Was banished from hence to %Mantua.%
He gone, her Father sought by foule constraint
To marrie her to %Paris:% But her Soule
(Loathing a second Contract) did refuse
To giue consent; and therefore did she vrge me
Either to finde a meanes she might avoyd
What so her Father sought to force her too:
Or els all desperately she threatned
Euen in my presence to dispatch her selfe.
Then did I giue her, (tutord by mine arte)
A potion that should make her seeme as dead:
And told her that I would with all post speed
Send hence to %Mantua% for her %Romeo%,
That he might come and take her from the Toombe.
But he that had my Letters (Frier %John%)
Seeking a Brother to associate him,
Whereas the sicke infection remaind,
Was stayed by the Searchers of the Towne,
But %Romeo% vnderstanding by his man,
That %Iuliet% was deceasde, returnde in post
Vnto %Verona% for to see his loue.
What after happened touching %Paris% death,
Or %Romeos% is to me vnknowne at all.
But when I came to take the Lady hence,
I found them dead, and she awakt from sleep:
Whom faine I would haue taken from the tombe,
Which she refused seeing %Romeo% dead.
Anone I heard the watch and then I fled,
What afterhappened I am ignorant of.
And if in this ought haue miscaried.
By me, or by my meanes let my old life
Be sacrificd some houre before his time.
To most strickest rigor of the Law.
  <S %Pry:%> We still haue knowne thee for a holy man,
Wheres %Romeos% man, what can he say in this?
  <S %Balth:%> I brought my maister word that shee was dead,
And then he poasted straight from %Mantua.%
Vnto this Toombe. These Letters he deliuered me,
Charging me early giue them to his Father.
  <S %Prin:%> Lets see the letters, I will read them ouer.
Where is the Counties Boy that calld the Watch?
  <S %Boy:%> I brought my Master vnto %Juliets% graue,
But one approaching, straight I calld my Master.
At last they sought, I ran to call the Watch.
And this is all that I can say or know.
  <S %Prin:%> These letters doe make good the Dryers wordes,
Come %Capolet%, and come olde %Mountagewe.%
Where are these enemies? see what hate hath done.
  <S %Cap:%> Come brother %Mountague% giue me thy hand,
There is my daughters dowry: for now no more
Can I bestowe on her, thats all I haue.
  <S %Moun:%> But I will giue them more, I will erect
Her statue of pure golde:
That while %Verona% by that name is knowne.
There shall no statue of such price be set,
As that of %Romeos% loued %Iuliet.%
  <S %Cap:%> As rich shall %Romeo% by his Lady lie,
Poore Sacrifices to our Enmitie.
  <S %Prin:%> A gloomie peace this day doth with it bring.
Come, let vs hence,
To haue more talke of these sad things.
Some shall be pardoned and some punished:
For nere was heard a Storie of more woe,
Than this of %Iuliet% and her %Romeo.%
